Project Overview: Implementing Algorithms with Kafka Consumer

In this project, the goal is to implement diverse algorithms within Kafka consumer scripts. Kafka, a distributed streaming platform, excels in processing large-scale data streams in real-time, making it an ideal platform for implementing streaming algorithms.

consumer1.py: Apriori Algorithm Implementation

The consumer1.py script incorporates the Apriori algorithm within a Kafka consumer.
The Apriori algorithm is a classic technique utilized for frequent itemset mining and association rule learning in data mining and analytics.
By reading data from a Kafka topic, the script applies the Apriori algorithm to uncover frequent itemsets and association rules.
Real-time insights and association rules are promptly printed as the algorithm processes incoming data.
consumer2.py: PCY Algorithm Implementation

The consumer2.py script integrates the PCY (Park-Chen-Yu) algorithm within a Kafka consumer.
PCY is an optimization method for the Apriori algorithm, aimed at reducing memory usage and computational overhead.
Similar to consumer1.py, this script consumes data from a Kafka topic and utilizes the PCY algorithm to detect frequent itemsets and association rules.
Real-time insights and association rules are generated as the algorithm analyzes incoming data.
consumer3.py: Custom Algorithm Implementation (SON Algorithm)

The consumer3.py script implements a custom algorithm, specifically the SON (Savasere, Omiecinski, and Navathe) algorithm, within a Kafka consumer.
SON is another popular algorithm for scalable frequent itemset mining in distributed environments.
Differing from the first two consumers, consumer3.py isn't confined to a predefined algorithm. Instead, it accommodates the implementation of any custom algorithm, fostering flexibility for experimentation and exploration.
Real-time insights or outputs pertinent to the selected custom algorithm are displayed as the algorithm processes incoming data.
By integrating these algorithms with Kafka consumers, the project facilitates the real-time processing of streaming data, enabling the derivation of meaningful insights or patterns from the data stream. Each consumer script operates autonomously, consuming data from Kafka topics and executing algorithmic computations tailored to its specific implementation. This approach fosters scalable and efficient processing of streaming data for a myriad of analytics and data mining tasks.
